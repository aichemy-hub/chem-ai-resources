# Chem & Materials AI Resources

This site collects **free, open, and community-friendly** resources for people
starting at the interface between:

- chemistry and machine learning / AI
- materials science and machine learning / AI

Use this as a jumping-off point for self-study, group reading lists, or onboarding
new researchers to the field.

Use the navigation on the left to explore resources by topic area, or
browse the full [resource index](resources.md).

If you have suggestions for new resources to add, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/aichemy-hub/chem-ai-resources/issues) or
read the [contribution guidelines](contributing.md) to submit a pull request.

## Starting from Scratch?

If you're new to programming, machine learning, or chemistry/materials science,
consider starting with some foundational resources:

- **Learn basic Python, specifically for chemists**  
  Start with [Introduction to Python for Chemists (Imperial College)](https://github.com/imperialchem/python-prog-intro) – a very gentle, notebook-based introduction aimed at chemistry students, with exercises and chemical examples.

- **Have an official reference that always matches the latest Python version**  
  Use [The Python Tutorial (Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) alongside the Imperial notes as a companion reference. It’s maintained with each Python release and gives a clean, language-level view of the core concepts.

- **Get an intuition for what “machine learning” means in plain language**  
  Read [Machine Learning for Everyone (In Simple Words)](https://vas3k.com/blog/machine_learning/) – a long-form blog post that explains ML concepts without equations, focusing on analogies and real-world examples.

- **Work through a structured, project-based ML course**  
  Once you’re comfortable with basic Python and high-level ideas, follow [Machine Learning for Beginners (Microsoft)](https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners) – a 12-week, project-driven curriculum using scikit-learn, with notebooks, quizzes and assignments.

- **Apply Python and ML ideas directly to chemistry data**  
  When you want to connect this back to real chemical problems, try [Data-Driven Chemistry (University of Edinburgh)](https://github.com/Edinburgh-Chemistry-Teaching/Data-driven-chemistry), which uses Jupyter notebooks and chemistry datasets to practise Python, plotting and basic data analysis in a chemistry context.
