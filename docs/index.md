# Chem & Materials AI Resources

This site collects **free, open, and community-friendly** resources for people
starting at the interface between:

- chemistry and machine learning / AI
- materials science and machine learning / AI

Use this as a jumping-off point for self-study, group reading lists, or onboarding
new researchers to the field.

Use the navigation on the left to explore resources by topic area, or
browse the full [resource index](resources.md).

If you have suggestions for new resources to add, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/aichemy-hub/chem-ai-resources/issues) or
read the [contribution guidelines](contributing.md) to submit a pull request.

## Starting from Scratch?

If you're new to programming, machine learning, or chemistry/materials science,
consider starting with some foundational resources:

TODO: add links to beginner-friendly resources on programming, ML, and chemistry
basics.

## Acknowledgements
